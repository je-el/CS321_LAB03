NewClient.c file

Objective: 
1. create two different clients
2. read messages from the user input rather than them being hardcoded
3. the server should forward the accepted message from one client to the next
4.should only work properly when two clients are up
5.server should end when one client sends BYE.
x6. cannot be aborted by hitting control-c in the sevrer, bbut I dunno if we also need it for the client file as well??
7.assume both client and server are one the same machine
8. send client pids to sever to establish connections
